## Math Bits for Kids: What is Caesar Cipher?


## Design Process 

**mathbitsforkids.com** will be a website with math resources for teaching kids. Teachers and students all over the world can access freely to the resources on the web site. The subjects (lessons) are for basic and medium education, that is ages from 5 up to 15 years old.

**Caesar Cipher v0.1** is a prototype of a web app that explains a math lesson, then motivate the student to try the lesson on paper and finally provides an interactive web app to try the knowledge acquired .

## Users and relation to the product


The goal is to teach a math lesson to the kid, "Caesar Cipher" and give them the chance to try the app and engage in a "secret message" game with their peers. So, it intends to **make learning** fun.

The app is a **helping tool** for teachers to get their students attention and involve them in **active learning** in a fun and appealing way.

**Users**
Although the site it's meant to be visited for adults and kids, the UX is mainly directed to kids, because it intends to get their attention and lead them to interact with the site and learn the lessons. So it uses bright colors, cartoon characters, friendly icons, etc...

## Problem solving

**The problem the app tries to solve** is boring math learning in the classroom by involving students in active, interactive learning activities.

## Problem solving
The web app uses a math formula, the next video explains the process to get the result (that is, how the app works):
